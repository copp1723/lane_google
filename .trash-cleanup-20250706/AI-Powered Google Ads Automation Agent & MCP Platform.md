## Project Understanding & Scope Analysis

### Core Business Problem

The current state of Google Ads management presents significant operational challenges that directly impact business efficiency and profitability. Organizations managing multiple advertising accounts face a complex web of manual processes that consume valuable human resources while introducing opportunities for costly errors and missed opportunities.

The primary pain points identified in the project documentation reveal a systematic problem with traditional Google Ads management approaches. Campaign creation requires deep technical expertise and substantial time investment, often taking hours or days to properly configure a single campaign with all necessary components including ad groups, keywords, ad copy, extensions, and targeting parameters. This lengthy setup process creates bottlenecks that prevent organizations from quickly responding to market opportunities or seasonal trends.

Daily monitoring and budget management represent another significant operational burden. Marketing teams must constantly track spending patterns, adjust budgets to maintain proper pacing, and identify performance issues before they impact campaign effectiveness. This reactive approach often results in discovering problems too late, leading to wasted ad spend from campaigns that overspend early in the month or underperform due to insufficient budget allocation.

The complexity multiplies exponentially when managing multiple client accounts or business units. Each account requires individual attention, monitoring, and optimization, making it virtually impossible to scale operations without proportionally increasing staff. This limitation constrains business growth and reduces the efficiency gains that should come with experience and expertise.
