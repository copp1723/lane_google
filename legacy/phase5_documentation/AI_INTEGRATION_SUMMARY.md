## Integration Points

### 1. Chat Interface
```python
# Frontend can stream responses
response = await fetch('/api/ai-agent/chat/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: "I want to create a campaign for my plumbing business",
    conversation_history: [...],
    context_type: "campaign_generation"
  })
});
```

### 2. Campaign Generation
```python
# Generate campaign from conversation
response = await fetch('/api/ai-agent/generate-campaign', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: conversationHistory
  })
});
```

### 3. Keyword Research
```python
# AI-powered keyword research
response = await fetch('/api/ai-agent/keyword-research', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    business_info: {
      name: "ABC Plumbing",
      description: "Professional plumbing services",
      services: ["drain cleaning", "pipe repair"],
      target_market: "homeowners"
    },
    competitors: ["XYZ Plumbing", "123 Plumbers"]
  })
});
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```bash
# OpenRouter API (primary)
